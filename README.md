# Motion-Detector

This project is a use case of Computer Vision. It tracks the amount of duration for which there is motion in front of camera and let us know by plotting a graph and a CSV file at the end. 

P.S. For better use, at the starting make sure that there is no motion in front of your in-built camera. And after some time, you put your hand or any object in motion.
